### Techniques

- Sometimes you do not need to store the whole DP table in memory; the last two values or the last two rows of the matrix will suffice.

### Essential Questions

- Climbing Stairs
- Coin Change
- House Robber
- Longest Increasing Subsequence

### Recommended Practice Questions

- 0/1 Knapsack or Partition Equal Subset Sum
